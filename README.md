# Retro TV-Themed Website

This project is a retro TV-themed website that combines nostalgic design elements with modern web technologies. The website features a vintage TV frame as the main visual element, with a video player seamlessly integrated into the screen, giving the illusion of a video playing on an old TV. 

# Features:
- **Retro Aesthetic:** Classic TV frame design with retro-style buttons and a matching background.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, with detailed media queries ensuring perfect alignment of elements across all screen sizes, from small smartphones to large desktops.
- **Search Functionality:** A search bar is positioned above the TV frame, styled to fit the retro theme, allowing users to search content directly.
- **Interactive Controls:** Retro-style buttons below the TV frame that simulate old-school control buttons, enhancing user interaction.

# Technologies Used:
- **HTML/CSS:** Core structure and styling of the website.
- **JavaScript:** For any interactive elements and functionality.
- **Media Queries:** Detailed adjustments to ensure responsive design across various devices.

This project is a great example of blending vintage design with modern web development practices, creating a unique and immersive user experience.
